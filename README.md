De Vince Code - Components

This project is made for faster building website/applications by having a base of the basic components commonly used. Like buttons, input fields.

The goal is to be able to prepare the recipes to be used in the website at first glance, even before making the whole project with KISS principle (Keep It Short & Simple).

Example, after defining the looks of the button to be used, then I can add all the styles to the button tag. That way, by the time I use the <button>, it already has the style, with the interaction state of the element. This should make the HTML feel more native with lesser tracking on class names. Also, it makes all of the elements uniform. This may be limited to websites with uniform UI, and might be hard to use for niche websites like showcase websites.
